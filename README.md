# 👋 Hi, I’m Vidyarani Uppin

🌱 I'm currently a graduate student in Computer Science at Fitchburg state University and a backend developer with a performance-driven mindset. I’m incredibly enthusiastic about new technologies and have a diligent work ethic.

👩🏻‍💻 I specialize in building robust backend systems using Java and Spring Boot, with a strong focus on microservices architecture, Kafka-based event streaming, and cloud-native deployment on platforms like AWS and Kubernetes.

🚀 I bring hands-on experience designing and deploying scalable, distributed applications, along with a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms. I'm always eager to learn and grow through real-world challenges and innovation.

☁️ My recent work involves cloud infrastructure automation, containerized deployments, and resilient API development using industry best practices.
